 * This class attempts to mirror what an actual gtest executable is comprised of.
 * For example, it contains a name (filepath) and contains a collection
 * of unit test suites. Thus, this structure is reflected in objects of this
 * type hold a number of GTestSuites which hold the actual GTests.
 * \note This file may separate into two or more classes to separate the
